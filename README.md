# advent-of-code-2020
My solutions and workings for the Advent of Code 2020 puzzles (www.adventofcode.com).

Each day is contained in its own folder with a 'puzzle input' file (copy-pasted from the advent of code page) and a Jupyter notebook with my working-out and solutions. Sometimes there is also a .py file - if i'm running something that for some reason doesn't agree with Jupyter notebooks!

I'm an intermediate-level Python user and would always appreciate feedback on structure and format - or recommendations for a more efficient solution!
